                <h2>First Trimester</h2>
                <p> The first trimester is from conception to 12 weeks. </p>
                <p> There are a variety of common symptoms that can appear in the first trimester including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Morning sickness</li>
                    <li>Fatigue</li>
                    <li>Swollen breasts</li>
                    <li>Frequent urination</li>
                    <li>Food aversions or cravings</li>
                    <li>Changes in bowel movements</li>
                </ul>
                <p> <em>Don't worry</em>, fatigue and morning sickness typically subside in the second trimester.<p>

                <p>Things you may want to think about or accomplish in your first trimester:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Start taking a prenatal vitamin ASAP</li>
                    <li>See your doctor</li>
                    <li>Review safety for pregnancy (foods, activities, etc)</li>
                    <li>Check your health insurance</li>
                    <li>Quit smoking and drinking</li>
                    <li>Limit caffeine and drink plenty of water</li>
                    <li>Exercise 30 minutes daily</li>
                    <li>Eat healthy foods</li>
                </ul>
                <p> You may be able to find out the sex of your baby in the first trimester through a blood test called "NIPT" or "Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing." Though it can be confirmed via ultrasound in the first trimester, it is likely too early to accurately assess, so it will be confirmed in your second trimester.<p>
